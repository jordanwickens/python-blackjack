## How to play
The objective is to get a hand total of **closer to 21 than the dealer** without going over 21 (busting). At the start of a Blackjack game, the players and the dealer receive two cards each. The players' cards are normally dealt face up, while the dealer has one face down (represented by an **X** in the console) and one face up.
